# CharacterCut Processing Failure Debug Guide

## Quick Test Execution

### Option 1: Run the Playwright Test
```bash
cd C:\Apps\background-remover
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install
npx playwright test tests/debug_processing_failure.spec.js --headed
```

### Option 2: Run the API Debug Script
```bash
cd C:\Apps\background-remover
node debug_api_test.js
```

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Initial Site Access
1. Navigate to: https://background-remover-jet.vercel.app/
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab and clear it
4. Take screenshot of initial page

### 2. Test Image Upload Methods

#### Method A: File Upload
1. Look for file input or upload button
2. Try uploading a small test image (any PNG/JPG)
3. Monitor Network tab for API calls
4. Note any error messages in Console tab

#### Method B: Drag and Drop
1. Find the drag-and-drop area
2. Drag a test image file onto it
3. Monitor for processing indicators
4. Check for error states

#### Method C: Paste Functionality
1. Copy an image to clipboard
2. Try Ctrl+V on the page
3. Monitor for paste handling

### 3. Error Detection Points

Watch for these specific failure indicators:

#### Network Failures
- Failed API calls (status 4xx/5xx)
- CORS errors
- Timeout errors
- Missing endpoints

#### Console Errors
- JavaScript errors
- Module loading failures
- API response errors
- Processing errors

#### UI Indicators
- Error messages displayed to user
- Stuck loading states
- Processing that never completes
- Missing result display

## Common Failure Scenarios

### Backend API Issues
- **Symptom**: Network calls to /api/* endpoints fail
- **Cause**: Backend not deployed or misconfigured
- **Check**: Verify API endpoints return valid responses

### CORS Issues
- **Symptom**: "CORS policy" errors in console
- **Cause**: Frontend and backend on different domains
- **Check**: Verify CORS headers in API responses

### Processing Library Failures
- **Symptom**: API accepts image but processing fails
- **Cause**: rembg library issues or serverless timeout
- **Check**: API response times and error messages

### File Handling Issues
- **Symptom**: Upload appears to work but no processing starts
- **Cause**: File format issues or client-side validation
- **Check**: Supported file types and size limits

## Key Files to Check

Based on the codebase structure:
- Frontend: Likely in `/src` or `/pages`
- API: Likely in `/api` or `/pages/api`
- Deployment: Vercel configuration files

## Expected API Endpoints

The application should have endpoints like:
- `/api/process` - Main image processing
- `/api/remove-background` - Background removal
- `/api/upload` - File upload handling

## Debug Checklist

- [ ] Site loads without console errors
- [ ] Upload interface is visible and functional
- [ ] Network requests are made when uploading
- [ ] API endpoints return appropriate responses
- [ ] Processing completes or shows clear error messages
- [ ] Results are displayed or downloadable

## Reporting Findings

When you find the issue, note:
1. **Exact error message** (from console or UI)
2. **Network request details** (URL, status, response)
3. **When the failure occurs** (upload, processing, result display)
4. **Browser and version** used for testing
5. **Screenshot** of the error state
