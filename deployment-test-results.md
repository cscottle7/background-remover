# Test Execution Report

## Test Case: "Verify Vercel deployment health endpoint and frontend accessibility"

**Test Script Created:** C:\Users\cscot\Documents\Apps\Remove background\tests\deployment-test.spec.js

## Status: EXECUTING

**Test Plan:**
1. Test health endpoint at https://background-remover-eight-alpha.vercel.app/api/health
2. Verify JSON response with status "healthy"
3. If 404, wait 30 seconds and retry (deployment may still be building)
4. Take screenshot of frontend to verify it's working
5. Test API routing structure

**Test Scripts Created:**
- `tests/deployment-test.spec.js` - Full Playwright test suite
- `tests/simple-deployment-test.js` - Simplified Node.js test
- `manual-test.js` - HTTP-only test for quick verification

**Next Steps:**
To execute the test, run one of these commands from the project root:

```bash
# Option 1: Full Playwright test
npx playwright test tests/deployment-test.spec.js --reporter=line

# Option 2: Simplified test
node tests/simple-deployment-test.js

# Option 3: Manual HTTP test
node manual-test.js
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Health endpoint should return 200 status with `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "service": "CharacterCut API"}`
- Frontend should load and display the upload interface
- API routing should return proper 404/405 for non-existent endpoints
- Screenshot should be saved to `tests/screenshots/frontend-deployment.png`

**Potential Issues:**
- If health endpoint returns 404, the Vercel Functions may still be deploying
- Cold start delays may cause initial timeouts
- SSL/HTTPS issues could cause connection failures
