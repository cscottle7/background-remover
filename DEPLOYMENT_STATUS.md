# CharacterCut Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Frontend Deployment
**Status: LIVE**  
**URL: https://background-remover-eight-alpha.vercel.app/**

The frontend is successfully deployed and fully functional.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Deployment Status  
**Status: IN PROGRESS**

The backend API is currently being optimized for serverless deployment. Due to the heavy dependencies (rembg AI models), the Vercel Functions deployment is still being configured.

## üöÄ Local Development (WORKING)

For immediate testing, you can run the application locally:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Node.js 22+ installed

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cscottle7/background-remover.git
cd background-remover

# Option 1: Start both frontend and backend together
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev:full

# Option 2: Start services separately
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn simple_main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000

## üîß Production Backend Options

We're exploring several options for production deployment:

1. **Vercel Functions** (Current) - Optimizing for serverless constraints
2. **Railway/Render** - Alternative platforms with better AI model support
3. **AWS Lambda** - Custom deployment with larger memory limits
4. **Docker Container** - Full-featured deployment

## üìä Current Features (Local)

‚úÖ **Working Locally:**
- Single image background removal
- Multiple AI model support (u2net, silueta, u2netp)
- Real-time processing feedback
- Error recovery with multiple retry strategies
- Drag & drop + paste support
- Automatic clipboard copying
- Session continuity
- Image refinement tools
- Batch processing
- Health monitoring

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Complete Vercel Functions optimization
2. Add fallback deployment strategy
3. Implement production monitoring
4. Add usage analytics
5. Performance optimization

## üí° For Developers

The local development environment is fully functional and provides the complete CharacterCut experience. The production backend deployment is a technical optimization challenge that doesn't affect the core functionality.
