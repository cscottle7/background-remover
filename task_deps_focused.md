## Task Breakdown & Dependencies

### Phase 1: Critical User-Facing Issues (URGENT)

#### Task 10: Fix Canvas Size to Fill Available Space (Critical)
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Dependencies:** None
**Description:** Canvas area is still too small despite previous fixes - needs to fill most of the right panel space

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `setupCanvasDimensions()` uses `containerHeight * 0.9` but container height is artificially limited
- CSS `.main-canvas-container` has `max-height: 100%` but parent containers don't expand to full viewport
- Canvas container padding of 40px reduces available space unnecessarily
- Height calculation uses `containerHeight - 40` which further reduces canvas size

**Technical Implementation:**
- Remove artificial height constraints in CSS (`.canvas-area`, `.main-canvas-container`)
- Change container sizing to use `calc(100vh - 120px)` for actual viewport height minus header/controls
- Reduce canvas padding from 40px to 20px (`maxHeight = containerHeight - 20`)
- Update height usage to `containerHeight * 0.95` for maximum space utilization
- Ensure `.refinement-container` uses full viewport (`height: 100vh`)

**Success Criteria:**
- Canvas takes up 80-90% of the right panel space
- Editing area is visually prominent and large enough for detailed work
- Canvas fits within viewport without scrollbars
- Maintains aspect ratio without distortion

---

#### Task 11: Fix Undo Button State Management (Critical)
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Dependencies:** None
**Description:** Undo button is always greyed out even when there should be stroke history to undo

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `canUndo()` function exists and works correctly (returns `currentHistoryIndex > 0 && strokeHistory.length > 1`)
- Issue likely in button's disabled state binding or initial history state setup
- `saveInitialMaskState()` may not be properly initializing the history
- Button disabled attribute uses `disabled={!canUndo()}` which should work

**Technical Implementation:**
- Debug the initial history state - ensure `saveInitialMaskState()` properly creates history[0]
- Add reactive statement to force undo button re-evaluation: `$: canUndoStrokes = canUndo()`
- Ensure `saveStrokeToHistory()` is called before every drawing operation starts
- Add console logging to track history state changes for debugging
- Verify button binding uses the reactive variable: `disabled={!canUndoStrokes}`

**Success Criteria:**
- Undo button becomes enabled after first brush stroke
- Button properly toggles between enabled/disabled based on actual history state
- Multiple undos work in sequence
- Button shows correct state after redo operations

---

#### Task 12: Fix Smart Tool Single-Use Bug (Critical)
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Dependencies:** None
**Description:** Smart erase and restore buttons only work once, then require clicking something else before working again

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Smart tools use click-to-activate pattern: `smartBackgroundErase()` sets `currentTool = 'smart-background-erase'`
- After one use, `handleMouseDown()` processes the click but tool doesn't reset properly
- Tool resets to 'restore' after operation: `// Reset tool to restore after operation`
- Issue is tool doesn't reset immediately, causing subsequent clicks to be ignored

**Technical Implementation:**
- Remove automatic tool reset after smart tool operations
- Add explicit tool state management for smart tools:
  - Keep tool active until user manually selects different tool
  - OR reset tool state immediately after each operation completes
- Fix tool button visual feedback to show when smart tool is active/ready
- Ensure `currentTool` state updates trigger proper UI re-rendering

**Success Criteria:**
- Smart erase works multiple times in succession without clicking other tools
- Smart restore works multiple times in succession
- Tool buttons show correct active/inactive state
- Operations complete reliably on every click

---

#### Task 13: Fix Info Button Visibility (High)
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Dependencies:** None
**Description:** User can't find the info button - might be hidden behind collapse button or too small

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Info button exists with class `.tool-info-button` next to "Tools" section title
- Button is very small (uses `w-3 h-3` classes) making it hard to notice
- May have z-index issues with collapse button or other UI elements
- Styling may blend into background making it nearly invisible

**Technical Implementation:**
- Increase info button size from `w-3 h-3` to `w-4 h-4` for better visibility
- Improve button contrast with stronger border and background colors
- Ensure button is positioned clearly separate from collapse controls
- Add subtle hover animation to make button more discoverable
- Consider adding text label "Info" alongside the icon

**Success Criteria:**
- Info button is easily visible and discoverable by users
- Button clearly indicates it provides help/information
- Clicking info button shows/hides tool descriptions properly
- Button doesn't conflict with other UI elements

### Phase 3: Slider Functionality & Tool Improvements (Critical Priority)

#### Task 7: Fix Background Sensitivity & Edge Refinement Sliders
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Dependencies:** Tasks 1 & 2 (stroke history and basic slider fixes)
**Description:** Make sliders actually affect image processing instead of just preview calculations

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Current sliders only modify client-side preview via `updatePreview()` function
- No backend API integration for real-time processing adjustments
- `backgroundSensitivity` and `edgeRefinement` variables don't connect to actual processing

**Technical Implementation:**
- Add API endpoint `/api/adjust-processing` that accepts sensitivity & refinement parameters

- Update slider feedback to show "Processing..." state during adjustments
- Cache original processed image and apply adjustments as overlays
- Add loading states and error handling for slider adjustments

**Alternative Lightweight Approach:**
- Use client-side alpha channel manipulation for background sensitivity
- Implement edge smoothing algorithms using canvas ImageData processing
- Add gaussian blur and edge detection for refinement effects
- Cache computation results for performance

**Success Criteria:**
- Background sensitivity visibly changes how much background is removed
- Edge refinement clearly smooths or sharpens edge transitions
- Changes are persistent and included in final output
- Sliders provide immediate visual feedback without blocking UI

---

#### Task 8: Fix Background Tolerance Slider Integration
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 6 (background tools foundation)
**Description:** Connect background tolerance slider to smart background operations

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Tolerance slider exists but only affects flood-fill operations

- No visual feedback for tolerance range

**Technical Implementation:**
- Add real-time tolerance preview when hovering over smart background buttons
- Show affected area highlights based on current tolerance setting
- Improve color similarity algorithm accuracy
- Add tolerance validation and range indicators

**Success Criteria:**
- Tolerance slider immediately shows which areas would be affected
- Smart background operations respect tolerance setting precisely
- Visual feedback helps users understand tolerance impact
- Operations are more predictable and controlled

---

#### Task 9: Differentiate Restore vs Smart Restore Tools
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 1 (stroke history system)
**Description:** Make restore and smart restore tools functionally different instead of just visual variants

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Both tools use identical canvas operations with minimal opacity difference
- Users can't tell what "smart" restore actually does differently
- No meaningful algorithmic difference between the tools

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Regular Restore:** Simple pixel restoration with hard edges (current behavior)
- **Smart Restore:** Add edge-aware restoration with:
  - Automatic edge detection around brush area
  - Gradient blending at restoration boundaries
  - Content-aware pixel sampling from surrounding original areas
  - Soft brush falloff for natural integration

**Alternative Implementation:**
- **Smart Restore:** Multi-sample restoration that analyzes surrounding context
- Sample multiple points around brush area from original image

// Background tools
let backgroundTolerance = 10;
let isCurrentlyDrawing = false;

// Layout state  
let controlsCollapsed = false;

// Info system
let showToolInfo = false;
let activeToolTip = '';

// Enhanced slider functionality
let isProcessingSliderChange = false;
let cachedOriginalImage: ImageData | null = null;

// Tool improvements
