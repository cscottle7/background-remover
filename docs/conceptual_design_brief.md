## Visual Inspiration Brief
Here are a few examples that align with the project's goal of a **fast, frictionless** and **minimalist** user experience for developers.
## TinyPNG
Link: https://tinypng.com/
Relevance: This is an exemplary model for a single-purpose utility tool. Its core strength, much like the goal for CharacterCut, is a large, obvious file dropzone that immediately communicates its function. The entire user journey from landing to download is minimal and efficient, directly reflecting the **Frictionless Workflow** and **Minimalist UX** principles defined in the ***PRD***.
## Linear
Link: https://linear.app/
Relevance: While a more complex application, Linear's aesthetic is a benchmark for modern developer tools. It uses a refined dark theme, sharp typography, and subtle gradients to create a focused, high-performance feel. This visual language would resonate well with CharacterCut's target audience of app and game developers.
Cleanup.pictures
Link: https://cleanup.pictures/
Relevance: This tool provides a simple 'before-and-after' comparison directly in the workspace, which is a core requirement for CharacterCut. The way it presents the processed image for verification before download is a valuable pattern for ensuring user confidence in the output. The focus remains on the single task, aligning with the ***MVP***'s scope.

## Conceptual Design Brief
This brief translates the project goals into a concrete design direction, grounded in the Discover Web Solutions Design System.
Recommended Mood & Aesthetic The overall mood should be efficient, precise, and developer-focused. The aesthetic must be minimalist and utilitarian, prioritising speed and clarity over ornamentation. The entire experience should embody the **Frictionless Workflow** principle , enabling a user to upload, process, and download an asset in seconds, as per the **Minimalist UX** definition. A dark theme is highly recommended to align with the common preferences of the target developer audience.

* Suggested Colour Palette To achieve a modern
* developer-focused dark theme
* the following colour tokens from the SOP: Core Component Design System & Style Guide should be used:
Background: --dws-color-neutral-900 (A very dark grey for the main background).
Surface: --dws-color-neutral-800 (A slightly lighter grey for contained elements like the upload area).
Primary Action: --dws-color-primary-500 (For the main **Download** button and key interactive elements).
Text/Headings: --dws-color-neutral-100 (A light grey/off-white for high-contrast, readable text).
Borders & Dividers: --dws-color-neutral-700 (For subtle separation of UI elements).
Feedback (Success): --dws-color-success-500 (For success states or notifications).
## Typography Recommendations Clarity and readability are paramount. The typographic scale from the Design System should be applied as follows
Main Heading (e.g., **CharacterCut**): Use --dws-typography-scale-h3 for a strong but not overpowering title.
Instructional Text (e.g., **Drag & Drop an image**): Use --dws-typography-scale-body-lg.
Button Labels & UI Text: Use --dws-typography-scale-body-md.
UI & Interaction Style Notes All components must adhere to the ***SOP***: Core Component Design System & Style Guide.
File Upload: The central element of the page should be a large file input area that explicitly supports both drag-and-drop and click-to-upload. This directly supports the core workflow.
Primary Actions: For the **Download ****PNG**** action , use the
Button component with the primary and contained variants to give it the highest visual emphasis.
Secondary Actions: Any secondary options (e.g., 'Upload another') should use the ghost or secondary variant of the Button component to maintain hierarchy.
Processing Feedback: While an image is being processed, the **Download** button should be disabled and show a loading state. A
Loading Indicator component, such as a Spinner, should be displayed over the preview area to manage user expectations, which aligns with the core principle of providing system Feedback.
Notifications: For feedback on success or errors (e.g., **File type not supported**), use the Toast / Snackbar component, as it provides ephemeral feedback without blocking the user's workflow.
