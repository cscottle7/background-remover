# Refine Feature Fix

## Problem Identified

The refine feature was failing because the frontend was not correctly configured to use the local backend API.

## Root Cause

1. **Environment Variable Loading**: The frontend wasn't picking up `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` from `.env.local`
2. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: Frontend was making requests to localhost:3000/3001 instead of localhost:8000

## Solution

### ✅ Backend is Working
- The `/refine` endpoint works perfectly: `http://localhost:8000/refine`
- The `/process` endpoint works: `http://localhost:8000/process`
- CORS is properly configured

### 🔧 Frontend Configuration Fix

The frontend needs to be properly configured to use the backend API. 

**Current Status:**
- Backend: `http://localhost:8000` ✅ Working
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3001` ✅ Working
- API Configuration: ❌ Needs Fix

### 📋 Steps to Fix

1. **Restart both services** to ensure environment variables are loaded:
   ```cmd
   # Stop current services (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart with:
   .\start-local-full.bat
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Loading**:
   - Frontend should pick up `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
   - Check browser Network tab to ensure API calls go to port 8000

3. **Test the Refine Feature**:
   - Upload an image
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Click "Edit/Refine" button
   - Should work without "Unknown Error"

### 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# Test backend refine endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/refine \
  -F "refined_image=@static/assets/icon-main-character.jpg" \
  -F "original_processing_id=test123"
```

This should return a successful JSON response.

### 🎯 Expected Behavior

After the fix:
1. Upload image → ✅ Processes successfully
2. Click "Edit/Refine" → ✅ Opens refinement interface
3. Make edits → ✅ Saves refinements
4. Submit → ✅ Processes without "Unknown Error"

The refine functionality is fully implemented in both frontend and backend - it just needed the correct API configuration.
