# ImageRefinementEditor Brush Tool Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Excessive Slider Updates
- Problem: Reactive statements were triggering constantly, even when values hadn't changed
- Cause: Svelte reactive statements firing on every component update
- Evidence: Console logs showed repeated "Background sensitivity changed to: 59"

### 2. Poor Debouncing Implementation  
- Problem: 150ms debounce timeout was insufficient
- Cause: No value tracking to prevent redundant updates
- Impact: Multiple preview updates per slider change

### 3. Mask Override by Slider Updates
- Problem: Brush strokes were immediately overridden by slider updates
- Cause: Slider reactive statements triggered updatePreview() calls during brush drawing
- Evidence: Brush strokes detected but not visually applied

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Reactive Statement Logic
- Added value tracking to prevent redundant updates
- Only trigger on actual value changes
- Added blocking mechanism during drawing

### 2. Enhanced Debouncing
- Increased debounce delay from 150ms to 500ms
- Added proper value tracking
- Added blocking mechanism during brush operations

### 3. Drawing State Protection
- Block slider updates during drawing
- Clear timeouts when drawing starts
- Re-enable slider updates after drawing completes

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added mask pixel count logging
- Better logging for troubleshooting
- More descriptive console messages

## Results Expected

1. Eliminated Console Spam: Slider changes only log when values change
2. Working Brush Restore: Brush strokes visually applied and preserved
3. Improved Performance: Fewer redundant preview updates
4. Better User Experience: Smoother interaction without competing updates

The fixes address the core issue where brush mask data was being overwritten by slider updates.
